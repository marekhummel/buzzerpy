# Buzzer.py #

Simple buzzing app made with python flask and socketio

Players can either host the game (only one host at the time) or join the game (if its already hosted)
The website presents a buzzer which for example can be used for quizzes. Additionally a stopwatch is integrated, so that the host can time the buzzer presses if needed.
